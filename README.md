# Clicky-Game

## Overview
 This is an simple memory game using React. 
 
## Instructions

1. This application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images renders to the page and shuffles themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
